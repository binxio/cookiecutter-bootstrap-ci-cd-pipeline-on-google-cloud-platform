serverless CI/CD pipeline for {{cookiecutter.project_name}} on Google Cloud Platform
===================================================================================


## bootstrap the CICD project
```
cd ./cicd
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## activate backend storage
```
sed -i ''  -e 's/#//' provider.tf
terraform init
Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "gcs" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "gcs" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "gcs"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes


Successfully configured the backend "gcs"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.
